# Dialogue Craft
A web application for creating characters and generating dialogue using Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and the co:here API.

A special thanks to [midudev](https://www.twitch.tv/midudev) for always creating great programming content moving the manitas, as well as hosting this hackathon along with [co:here](https://cohere.ai/).
## What is this application about?
We will make use of the co:here API and YOUR creativity.

You will be able to create a list with the characters you wish (they will be saved in localStorage).

Then you can use them and make them interact as you wish describing a situation for the dialogue you would want the co:here AI to generate.
